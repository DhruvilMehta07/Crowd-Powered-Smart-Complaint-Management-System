# Crowd-Powered-Smart-Complaint-Management-System
Users submit complaints (road damage, Wi-Fi issues, noise). The system learns to automatically classify and prioritize complaints based on feedback (urgency, location, frequency) using FL if privacy is a concern.

## The Problem: Outdated Systems, Frustrated Citizens  
Today, getting a pothole fixed or a broken streetlight repaired is often a slow and frustrating process. Traditional reporting methods like phone calls or outdated web portals lack transparency, leading to complaints being lost, duplicated, or ignored.  

This inefficiency results in:  
- Prolonged public safety hazards  
- Wasted resources  
- A growing disconnect between citizens and their local government  

---

## Our Vision: Community-Powered Solutions  
We aim to create a **modern platform** that transforms how urban issues are reported and resolved. By leveraging the **power of the community** and **artificial intelligence**, our system ensures that civic problems are identified, prioritized, and fixed faster than ever before.  

---

## How It Works  
1. **Report in Seconds**  
   - Citizens open the app, take a photo of the issue (e.g., garbage overflow, clogged gutter), and select a category.  
   - The app automatically tags the time and location.  

2. **Use of AI**  
   - Instantly analyzes the report  
   - Categorizes the issue, checks for duplicates, and assesses urgency (e.g., a gas leak near a school is high-priority).  

3. **Transparent Tracking**  
   - Complaint is routed to the correct municipal department.  
   - Citizens receive a **unique tracking ID** and can monitor status from *Received → In Progress → Resolved* in real-time.  

4. **Community Validation**  
   - Users can upvote existing reports in their area.  
   - Helps authorities gauge impact and prioritize effectively.
